It is true to quote the proverb in the prevailing condition of any Public School, BSEB Colony, Patna still the school had been listed in the best schools of the country by the combined efforts and hard work of the students and able guidance of teachers.As the captain of the ship, I feel very proud that the school had been declared one of the best schools in the country on the basis of survey conducted by channel 4 in 21 cities of India and Education World Magazine (Indian Schools Ranking) in the years 2012 to 2015. Every child is born with its own shaping spirit and creativity in various forms which if nurtured well, blossoms. The school offers opportunity to the young minds to develop their inner talent along with the artistic expression of creativity in the art and science of understanding the world in their own way.

SCHOOL BSEB has been holding its position in academics marching ahead tirelessly spreading the message of SCHOOL movement through quality education to the children of tomorrow’s pride of nation. The remarkable and commendable results of standard X and XII is a step ahead for the junior to follow their senior in coming future.

The school has earned name and fame for maintaining value education in Anglo Vedic Style which is the true essence of quality education for the young generation to keep pace with the ever changing world. It is high time to ensure perfect co – ordination between the school and the parents in order to nurture the young minds physically, mentally and spiritually.

I express my deep gratitude to all the dignitaries for their good wishes for the school. I congratulate teacher, parents, staff and students who left no stone unturned for the success of the school
